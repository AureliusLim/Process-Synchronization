### Input
The program accepts three inputs from the user.

n – the number of slots inside the fitting room

b – number of blue threads

g – number of green threads

### Output
The output of the program is a simulation that includes the following:

When a blue thread is the first to enter an empty fitting room, the thread should print the string “Blue only.”
When a green thread is the first to enter an empty fitting room, the thread should print the string “Green only.”
When a thread enters the fitting room, the thread should print its thread ID and color (i.e., blue or green).
When a thread is the last to exit the fitting room, the thread should print the string “Empty fitting room.”
Required Program Interaction
There should be minimal program interaction. The program will ask the user to input the values for n, b, and g.
